# Strawberry Pack

If Regular is Vanilla and Modded is Chocolate, then *this* is Strawberry

## What's It Do?
The Strawberry Pack attempts to improve the Vanilla experience with crafting recipe improvements, fun new features and quality of life changes.

For full details, check out the Repository's Wiki.

### Adds New Features

- Destructive Projectiles!
Arrows and tridents shatter glass panes and flower pots!
(can be toggled off with `/function strawberry:gamerule/destructive_projectiles/false` for those that don't want that!)

- Warp System!
Wish fast travel were easier? Now it is! The Strawberry Pack includes a multiplayer friendly warp system that allows you to spend your hard earned levels creating End Gateway Blocks to take you wherever you desire! Just remember to SAVE some coordinates before you go using it, or you'll create a portal to the void (AKA ***Death***). This System can ONLY be used in the Overworld! If you'd rather not have it at all, you can disable it with `/function strawberry:gamerule/warp/false`

- Hot Tools!
Fire Aspect or the appropriate Golden Tool (Because gold needs a little love) will drop most items in their smelted states (unless you have silk touch). This means digging up sand with a Fire Aspect Sword or Golden Shovel will drop *glass*.

### Improves Vanilla Recipes

- Stairs give you **8 instead of 4**.

- Crafting Bark/Wood (6 sided logs) blocks gives **4 instead of 3**.

- Smelting logs yields **coal instead of charcoal**. Why can't you make charcoal blocks?
